# AstroBot

**By: Mahdi Shirazi & Aria Bagherzadeh**

This is our final project for "Basics & Applications of Artificial Intelligence" course, which we attended at our university (University of Science & Culture, Iran). Project had 3 parts (questions); First part is about pathfinding system of our robot, which has been developed using BFS Algorithm. Second part is about finding the optimal combination for solar panel placement using Genetic Algorithm. Finally, Third part deploys a task assignment system, backed by Backtracking Algorithm.

**What's in this Project?**

There are 3 files for each part of this project:
- Raw Code (Python)
- Visualization Code (Using 'matplotlib')
- Jupyter Notebook File

**Description:**

Part 1 is about developing a pathfinder system for our robot, which we decided to use BFS Algorithm for it, since it's better in short paths and memory management than DFS Algorithm.

Part 2 uses Genetic Algorithm to find the optimal solution to solar panel placement problem.

Finally, Part 3 uses Backtracking Algorithm to assign tasks to subsystems of our robot.

**Minimum Configurations:**
- Python: v3.12.6 or above
- Pip: v25.1.1

**Used Libraries/Modules/Packages:**
- sys
- copy
- pillow
- random
- matplotlib
- collections (deque)
